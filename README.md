##GoogleLoginDemo
This simple ionic project shows how to perform social login with Google account in a phonegap app.
**Official google+ cordova plugin** (https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-googleplus) must be installed to **allow SocialAuth** class to perform login with Google account.

The app must be used in a real device.
